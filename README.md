## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
Ensure you have MongoDB installed locally or access to a MongoDB Atlas cluster.
The default connection string is `mongodb://localhost:27017/hiresense`.

### 2. Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory: 
   `cd backend`
2. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`. It contains:
   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/hiresense
   JWT_SECRET=super_secret_hiresense_jwt_token
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```
4. Start the server:
   `npm run dev` (Runs on http://localhost:5000)

### 3. Frontend Setup
1. Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:
   `cd frontend`
2. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
3. Start the Vite React development server:
   `npm run dev` (Runs on http://localhost:5173 - or as specified by Vite in terminal)

### 4. How to use
- Open the frontend URL in your browser.
- **Register** a new account.
- In the DB, you can manually update your role to `"admin"` to access the admin panel, otherwise you are a standard `"user"`.
- Navigate to **Resume Builder** and fill out the details. Download your generated resume PDF.
- Navigate to **Mock Interview**, allow camera and microphone permissions, and speak your answers clearly while avoiding switching tabs (which the Proctoring engine records).
- See your **Dashboard** for data visualization!
